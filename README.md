# TestSongs
Songs to test new playlist ids added to Cataclysm DDA. You can use them on their own, or place the two folders(only those, and not soundpack.txt) inside any soundpack that you're playing with. If everything's working as intended, you should be able to hear them whenever you hear music in-game.
